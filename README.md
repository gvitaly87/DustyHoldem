### Context

A multiplayer poker game that offers all the functionality expected out of a Texas Hold'em game. The app uses websocket and express in order to exchange information with the clients, and run several games simultaneously.

- The game starts from clicking the play now button and either creating a game, or joining an existing game.
- Once there are at least 3 players connected to a new game the game begins.
- Users that join after the game starts are added to the que, and start playing from the very next hand.
